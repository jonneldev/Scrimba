                <h3>Diving into Full-Stack Development at Zuitte</h3>
                <p>Learned the basics of full-stack development. At Zuitte Bootcamp, I explored the integration of frontend and backend technologies, starting with creating APIs and connecting them to user interfaces. I also gained hands-on experience with Node.js and Express.js for server-side development and MongoDB for database management. This bootcamp emphasized practical application, so I worked on building a simple yet functional CRUD app, which allowed me to see how everything comes together. This experience opened my eyes to the power of full-stack development.</p>

                <h3>Building Solid Foundations with The Odin Project</h3>
                <p>Learned basic HTML, CSS, and Git. The Odin Project provided a comprehensive introduction to web development. It taught me not only the syntax of HTML and CSS but also how to structure content semantically and design pages for real-world use cases. The Git lessons were particularly insightful, as I learned how to version control my projects effectively, collaborate with others, and deploy projects seamlessly. These foundational skills have set the stage for more advanced learning and reinforced my passion for coding.</p>
